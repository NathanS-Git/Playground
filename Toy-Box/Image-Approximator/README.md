Fourier Feature Mapping

My personal implementation of the paper "Fourier Features Let Networks Learn High Frequency Functions in Low Dimensional Domains". I find it hard to wrap my head around how simply adding fourier features allows a network to learn the features of an image dramtically better, yet it does. Interesing to watch it happen
